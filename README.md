## 🚨 Why CosmicOrbit?

* Space is vast. Space is beautiful. And yet, often our access to interactive, realtime, web‑based space‑visualizations is limited.
* CosmicOrbit combines modern web graphics (three.js, WebGL) with real‑world data via NASA APIs to present an experience that’s visually rich *and* informative.
* It’s more than a demo—it’s a mini mission: fly through the solar system, observe planet motion, experience lens‑flare and post‑processing effects, and browse through mission control UI elements while the universe unfolds around you.

## ✨ Key Features

* Interactive 3D solar system: planets orbiting, rotating, casting subtle shadows.
* Real‑time space data from NASA APIs.
* Lens flare, bloom, atmosphere shaders, and dynamic lighting.
* Mission‑control themed UI panel.
* Ambient space audio.
* Fully responsive across devices.
