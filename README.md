*A captivating 3D Solar System Explorer experience*

Welcome to **CosmicOrbit** — an immersive web‑application that invites you to explore our solar system in full 3D, complete with realistic planet orbits, dynamic visuals, real‑time data and a mission control‑style UI. Whether you’re a space enthusiast, a developer, a student of astrophysics, or just someone who enjoys cool browser experiences, CosmicOrbit brings the wonders of space to your screen.

## 🚨 Why CosmicOrbit?

* Space is vast. Space is beautiful. And yet, often our access to interactive, realtime, web‑based space‑visualizations is limited.
* CosmicOrbit combines modern web graphics (three.js, WebGL) with real‑world data via NASA APIs to present an experience that’s visually rich *and* informative.
* It’s more than a demo—it’s a mini mission: fly through the solar system, observe planet motion, experience lens‑flare and post‑processing effects, and browse through mission control UI elements while the universe unfolds around you.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Interactive 3D solar system: planets orbiting, rotating, casting subtle shadows.
* Real‑time space data from NASA APIs.
* Lens flare, bloom, atmosphere shaders, and dynamic lighting.
* Mission‑control themed UI panel.
* Ambient space audio.
* Fully responsive across devices.
